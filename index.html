    <main>
    <p> Hi, I'm Anjalee!! I grew up in Northville, MI and our downtown is filled with Victorian-era architecture and small coffee shops. 
        From a young age, my family and I have been traveling from Alaska all the way to 
        South Africa (My scariest experience was when I was left behind in the Sydney subway station), 
        so travel is a big passion of mine! At home, I have a puppy named Luna and I
         really enjoy working with/teaching kids about coding in my local elementary. 
         My favorite activity is dancing whether it be ballet or other classical forms. In my free time I like to read/watch 
         Sci-Fi novels and shows (The Handmaid's Tale and The 100 are my go tos). 
         I'm hoping to pursue a career where I can use my passion for accessible design and marketing
         to improve consumers' lives within the technology industry. 
    </p>
    <p> As a junior at the University of Michigan pursuing a dual degree in Business and User Experience Design (UX) 
        with interests in technology and marketing, I've learned a lot and I can't wait to learn more. My growth isn't confined 
        to the classroom though, with my involvements as VP of Business Development in Community Consulting Club and as a 
        teacher for Seven Mile Coding bridging the digital divide, I know that there are so many ways to empower and understand one another. 
        This site is meant to be a creative outlet where I can show you my work and my passions. 
        Please feel free to reach me at 734-890-8743 or panjalee@umich.edu! 
        </p>
